## 0.1.0

This is the first beta release of `BambuserLiveVideoShoppingPlayer`.

This version makes it possible to create players in different ways:

* `LiveVideoShoppingPlayer` for SwiftUI
* `LiveVideoShoppingPlayerView` for UIKit
* `LiveVideoShoppingPlayerViewController` for UIKit

You can also configure the player, listen for events, trigger functionality within the player etc.

The repository contains a basic SwiftUI demo. A UIKit demo will be added later.

Documentation and the readme is still work in progress and will be improved in later versions.
