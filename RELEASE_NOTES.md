# Release Notes

BambuserLiveShoppingPlayer will follow semver after the first major release.

Until then, the SDK is considered beta and may have breaking changes between minor versions.


## 0.0.1

This is the first alpha release of `BambuserLiveShoppingPlayer`.

This version makes it possible to create players in different ways:

* `LiveShoppingPlayer` for SwiftUI
* `LiveShoppingPlayerView` for UIKit
* `LiveShoppingPlayerViewController` for UIKit

You can also configure the player, listen for events, trigger functionality within the player etc.

The repository also contains a basic SwiftUI demo. A UIKit demo will be added later.

Documentation and the readme is still work in progress and will be improved in later versions.
