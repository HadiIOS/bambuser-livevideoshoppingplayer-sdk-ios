# Release Notes

This library will follow semver after the first major release.

Until then, the library is an experimental beta that may have breaking changes between minor versions.


## 0.2

### ‚ú® New features

* `CalendarEvent` is a new type that can be extracted from a `PlayerEventInfo` that contains valid calendar data.
