# Bambuser Live Video Shopping Player (Beta)

`BambuserLiveVideoShoppingPlayer` simplifes the integration of the Bambuser Live Video Shopping player in any iOS app.


## Beta Version

**NOTE!** This project is in early stages of development. Feel free to experiment with it but refrain from using it in production for now. 

See the [release notes][ReleaseNotes] for status and progress.


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

You can install `BambuserLiveVideoShoppingPlayer` with SPM:

```
https://github.com/bambuser/bambuser-livevideoshoppingplayer-sdk-ios
```

After installing the library in your app, remember to import `BambuserVideoLiveShoppingPlayer` in every file where you want to use it.


## Platform Support

The library supports iOS 13+ and can be used with `UIKit` and `SwiftUI`.


### UIKit

When using `UIKit`, you can create a player like this:

```
let player = LiveVideoShoppingPlayerView(
    configuration: playerConfiguration)
```

You can then add the player anywhere in your app, resize it to fit your needs etc. Read more about configuration the player further down.

You can also use the `LiveVideoShoppingPlayerViewController` if you want to wrap the view.


### SwiftUI

When using `SwiftUI`, you can create a player like this:

```
let player = LiveVideoShoppingPlayer(
    showId: "The ID of the show to watch",
    configuration: playerConfiguration)
```

You can then add the player anywhere in your app, resize it to fit your needs etc. Read more about configuring the player further down.


## Player Configuration

You can useÂ a `PlayerConfiguration` to configure your live shopping player. 

The configuration specifies things like theme, UI element, button configuration, event handlings etc.


## Demo apps

The `Demo` folder contains a `SwiftUI` demo app. 

Have a look at it for examples on how to add a live shopping player to your app.
