# Bambuser Live Video Shopping Player (Beta)


## About

`BambuserLiveVideoShoppingPlayer` is a Swift-based SDK for iOS, that aims to simplify adding a Bambuser Live Video Shopping Player to your app.

The SDK lets you add a player to your app, applying a configuration that controls how it looks and behaves. Once the player is loaded, you can listen for events that are emitted by the player. 

The SDK supports iOS 13+ and can be used with `UIKit` and `SwiftUI`.



## Beta Version

This project is in early stages of development. Feel free to experiment with it, but refrain from using it in production for now. Although, the SDK will follow semver after the first major release, it will have breaking changes between minor versions until then.

Some current limitations are that it's not possible to use native PiP (read more further down) or listen to all available events. 

See the [release notes][ReleaseNotes] for status and progress.



## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/bambuser/bambuser-livevideoshoppingplayer-sdk-ios
```

After installing the SDK, you must import `BambuserVideoLiveShoppingPlayer` in every file where you want to use it.



## Getting started

### UIKit

With `UIKit`, you can create a player like this:

```
let player = LiveVideoShoppingPlayerView(
    showId: "The ID of the show to watch",
    configuration: playerConfiguration)
```

You can then add the player anywhere in your app, resize it to fit your needs etc.

Read more about configuration the player further down and have a look at the UIKit demo for examples.


### SwiftUI

With `SwiftUI`, you can create a player like this:

```
let player = LiveVideoShoppingPlayer(
    showId: "The ID of the show to watch",
    configuration: playerConfiguration)
```

You can then add the player anywhere in your app, resize it to fit your needs etc. 

Read more about configuration the player further down and have a look at the SwiftUI demo for examples.



## Player Configuration

You can useÂ a `PlayerConfiguration` to configure the player instance. 

This configuration specifies the following configuration parameters, of which most are optional:

* `buttons` - Button configuration
* `eventHandler` - A block that receives player events  
* `isViewerSubscribed` - Whether or not the viewer is subscribed 
* `localeInfo` - Locale information that should be passed to the player
* `theme` - The client-specific theme to use for the player, if any 
* `shareAutoplay` - Whether or not a shared show should autoplay 
* `shareBaseUrl` - The base URL to apply when sharing a show
* `streamer` - Information about the current streamer
* `ui` - UI configuration

### PlayerConfiguration.Buttons

This configuration specifies the following button configurations:

* `checkout` - The behavior of the checkout button 
* `dismiss` - The behavior of the dismiss button
* `product` - The behavior of product links

### PlayerConfiguration.LocaleInfo

This configuration specifies the following locale configurations:

* `currency` - An optional string that describes the current currency 
* `locale` - An optional string that describes the current locale
* `trimPriceTrailingZeros` - Whether or not to trim trailing zeros in product prices

### PlayerConfiguration.Streamer

This configuration specifies the following streamer configurations:

* `name` - An optional string that describes the streamer name 
* `avatar` - An optional string that describes the streamer avatar

### PlayerConfiguration.UI

This configuration specifies the following UI configurations:

* `cartView` - The enabled state of the cart view 
* `cartButton` - The enabled state of the cart button
* `chatOverlay` - The enabled state of the chat overlay
* `productList` - The enabled state of the product list
* `productView` - The enabled state of the product view
* `shareButton` - The enabled state of the share button
* `subscribeButton` - The enabled state of the subscribe button


## Player Events

The player emits `PlayerEventInfo` to the event handler you inject into the player configuration.

The event info contains a reference to the `player`, the triggered `event` as well as a raw, event-specific `data` dictionary. It also provides functions for accessing typed data from the raw data dictionary, such as `url`, `value` and `calendarEvent`.

### Events

The following player events are currently supported:

* `addProductToCart`- Emitted when an item is added to the cart.
* `addShowToCalendar`- Emitted when an add to calendar button is tapped.
* `checkoutCart`- Emitted when the cart checkout button is tapped.
* `hideCart`- Emitted when the cart should be hidden.
* `hideChatOverlay`- Emitted when the chat overlay should be hidden.
* `hideProductList`- Emitted when a product list should be hidden.
* `playerDidBecomeReady`- Emitted when the player becomes ready for interaction.
* `playerDidClose`- Emitted when the player closes and will be deallocated.
* `playerDidLoad`- Emitted when the player completes loading the show.
* `playerDidSwipeDown`- Emitted when the user swipes down on the player.
* `playerDidSwipeLeft`- Emitted when the user swipes left on the player.
* `playerDidSwipeRight`- Emitted when the user swipes right on the player.
* `playerDidSwipeUp`- Emitted when the user swipes up on the player.
* `provideProductData`- Emitted when the player requests you to provide product data.
* `shareShow`- Emitted when the share button is tapped.
* `showCart`- Emitted when the cart should be presented.
* `showChatOverlay`- Emitted when the chat overlay should be presented.
* `showProductList`- Emitted when a product list should be presented.
* `showProductView`- Emitted when product information should be presented.
* `subscribe`- Emitted when the user taps `subscribe`.
* `syncCartState`- Emitted when the player needs information regarding the cart.
* `unsubscribe`- Emitted when the user taps `unsubscribe`.
* `updateItemInCart`- Emitted when the user changes the quantity of any items in the card.
* `updateShowStatus`- Emitted whenever the show status updates (e.g. pending, ready).


## Picture-in-Picture

The library currently doesn't provide native PiP support.

The demo apps shows you rough ways how to implement PiP in your own app.

* The `UIKit` demo creates a separate window in which it places the minimized player.
* The `SwiftUI` demo just minimizes the player, but never moves it around. 

These demos are not meant to be taken as production ready solutions, but rather meant to share experimental approaches for handling an in-app minip player.


## Demo apps

The `Demo` folder contains a `SwiftUI` and a `UIKit` demo app. 

Have a look at these apps for examples on how to add a live shopping player to your app.
